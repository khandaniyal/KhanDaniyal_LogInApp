**Documentation**

**I am going to briefly explain the few things I added on the app in terms of visual elements.**

**The .apk is located inside app/release/app-release.apk**

- I added two images. One is a logo and the other one is a title as shown here.

- For the Log in verification I inserted a Vector Asset which is invisible until the credentials are correct. This is the Vector Asset in action.

- In the other case it shows an error.

- And the last silly thing I added is a slight animation that takes all the elements of the Log In screen and slides them upwards when you launch the app. This is documented on the .java file.

- For this first mini app project it turned out to be a quite classy and minimalist Log In scrren. All of the extra little things are documented on the MainActivity.java.
